        <h2 id="h1">Batman and Robin 1997 Script 1</h2>
        <p id="p1">THE SKYLIGHT - CLOSE.  EXPLODES.
            Batman free-falls into
            the room, hitting the brontosaurus and sliding down its neck,
            SMASHING Freeze with his feet, the diamond sliding
            across the frozen floor.

            FREEZE
            (aiming his pistol)
            Bat on ice, anyone?
        </p>

    <div id="t2">

        <h2 id="h2">Batman and Robin 1997 Script 2</h2>
        <p id="p2">Batman KICKS the pistol high in the air, catches it.

            BATMAN
            Didn't your mother ever tell you not
            to play with guns?

            Freeze cartwheels across the room, kicking the gun away
            from Batman, catching it in mid air.

            FREEZE
            You're not sending me to the cooler.

            Freeze FIRES.  Batman dodges the blast.  Freeze takes aim
            again.

        <h2 id="h3">Batman and Robin 1997 Script 3</h2>
        <p id="p3">THE FRONT DOORS - CLOSE.  BLOW OPEN
            Robin, on the Redbird, flies into the room.

            BATMAN uses the distraction, flying-kicks the gun into
            the air.

            ROBIN soars over Freezeï¿½s head, kicks the airborne gun to
            the altar atop the giant pyramid.

            ROBIN
            Score.  And the crowd goes wild.
        </p>

    <div id="t4">

        <h2 id="h4">Batman and Robin 1997 Script 4</h2>
        <p id="p4">Robin lands, laying his bike sideways in a slide,
            KNOCKING a precious vase into mid air.  he grabs a statue,
            using it to whip around in a dismount.

            BATMAN catches the falling vase, replaces it, as Robin
            skates beside him.  The two heroes race for Freeze.

            FREEZE
            Grab the gem.  Kill the heroes.

            MORE INCEMEN in hockey masks, sticks in hand, rush the
            caped crusaders from both sides.

            ROBIN
            It's the hockey team from hell.
